Sphinx is a tool for building documentation.

## What does sphinx produce?

> ## Exercise
> In a group, have each member open one of the following packages' documentation
> - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
> - [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
> - [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/)
> - [scipy-cookbook](https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/)
> - [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
>
> Discuss what the common components are, what is helpful about these
> documentation sites, how they address the general concepts on documentation,
> how they're similar and how they're different.
>
>
> > ## Solution
> > these all use sphinx to generate them?

## Sphinx quickstart

Install Sphinx if you haven't done so already:

~~~
pip install sphinx
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Move into the directory that is to store your documentation: 

~~~
cd docs
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Start the interactive Sphinx quickstart wizard, which creates a Sphinx config file, `conf.py`, using your preferences.

~~~
sphinx-quickstart
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Suggested responses to the wizard's questions:

* *Separate source and build directories?* -> yes
* *Project name* -> sensible to re-use the package name
* *Author name(s)* -> list of authors
* *Project release* -> sensible to re-use the package version specified in `setup.py` (see lesson 3) e.g. '0.1'
* Project language -> `en`, but you may want to target other languages as well/instead. 

This will create:

* `docs/source/conf.py` -> Sphinx configuration file
* `docs/source/index.rst` -> Sphinx main index page, which like almost all Sphinx content, is written in reStructured Text (like Markdown)
* `docs/Makefile` -> for performing various tasks on Linux/macOS e.g. building HTML or a PDF
* `docs/make.bat` -> for performing those tasks on Windows

You should now be able to build and serve this basic documentation site using:

~~~
make html
python3 -m http.server -d build/html
~~~
{: .language-bash}

When you browse to the URL shown in the output of the second command
you can see your HTML documentation site but it's looking fairly bare!
Let's learn a little more about reStructuredText then start adding some content to our documentation site.

## Adding literal documentation

FIXME: RST overview

FIXME: adding pages

## API Documentation

Add an api line to the `index.rst` so that it has a link to it.

The create an API.rst file:

~~~

==================


~~~
{: .language-bash}

{% include links.md %}
